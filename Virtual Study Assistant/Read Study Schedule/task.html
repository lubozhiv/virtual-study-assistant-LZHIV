<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5><p>Welcome to your first Python project! This project is a practical task that helps you apply the Python skills you’ve learned so far. The Virtual Study Assistant is designed to be simple and approachable, introducing you to fundamental programming concepts while solving a real-world problem.</p><p>Just like any project, we’ll break it down into manageable stages. For instance, instead of building an entire assistant in one go, we’ll focus on smaller steps such as displaying a study schedule, performing calculations, and tracking progress. Each stage will guide you toward the final result, with clear objectives and examples.</p><p>Below, you’ll find the details for each stage. Follow the instructions carefully, write your code in the editor, and test your solution. Once you’ve completed a stage successfully, move on to the next step to keep building your Virtual Study Assistant. Good luck, and have fun coding!</p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>You've recently decided to organize your study schedule for the upcoming exams. Your plan includes dedicating specific amounts of time to subjects like Math, Science, History, etc. To begin, you'll read a simple study plan for each subject and the time you’ve allocated for it. This first step will help you get started on creating your Virtual Study Assistant!</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ul><li><p>Allow users to input their study subjects and the time (in minutes) required for each subject</p></li><li><p>Continue reading input until the user enters an empty string to finish</p></li><li><p>Save the input data in a dictionary where the keys are subject names and the values are the allocated times</p></li><li><p>If an input is empty, then we shouldn't print any information</p></li><li><p>Take care of input type validation for duration info. If the type of input info is not an integer, your script should ask for this information again</p></li></ul><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><strong>Input:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-python">Enter subject name: Math
Enter time allocated for Math: 90
Enter subject name: Science
Enter time allocated for Science: 120
Enter subject name:</code></pre><p><strong>Input subjects should be saved in dict</strong></p><pre><code class="language-python">subjects = {"Math": 90, "Science": 120}</code></pre>
